Nabilla.js
==========

This awesome and essential js library removes everything between the &lt;head>&lt;/head> tags. Inspired by https://github.com/fbrandel/ParisHilton.js

Because in France we have our Paris Hilton, Nabilla, I decided to created the french version of Florian Brandel's ParisHilton.js javascript library.

## How it works

* git clone or download the zip
* Take the js file
* Put it in your head or at the bottom of your site


## There are two versions of the script

### Native Javascript

Your website looks like Nabilla now : Nothing in the brain and boobs everywhere (each div of the site have now a class "boobs" - it does nothing in your css -)

### Jquery (You need jquery 1.8+)

This script has the same effect as the native version. BUT with jquery **every** a tag of your website is now prevented and plays the **too** famous "allo-quoi" quote at the end of the sound, the browser redirects you to the good webpage. You also need to put the file "nabilla-allo-quoi.ogg" into your folder (by default the ogg file is in the same folder as the script).
