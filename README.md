Nabilla.js
==========

This awesome and essential js library removes everything between the &lt;head>&lt;/head> tags. Inspired by https://github.com/fbrandel/ParisHilton.js

Because in France we have our Paris Hilton, I decided to created the french version of Florian Brandel's ParisHilton.js javascript library.

## How it works

* git clone or download the zip
* Take the js file
* Put it in your head or at the bottom of your site
* It looks like Nabilla now. Nothing in the brain and boobs everywhere (each div of the site have now a class "boobs")
